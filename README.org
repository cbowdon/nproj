* NProj - a CLI for .NET project management

- Commands for managing .NET project files, with a familiar interface.
- Current status: in progress Focusing on F# support.
- N.B. managing NuGet packages intentionally excluded: use nuget.exe or paket.

** TODO Initializing a project

#+begin_src
nproj init <path="."> --lang=(csharp|fsharp) --type=(library|exe)
#+end_src

Creates a new project file. Will also create an AssemblyInfo file.

|-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PATH            | Path to a directory to create a new project file in, taking the directory name as the project file name. Defaults to the current directory. |
| --lang=LANGUAGE | Acceptable values are =csharp= or =fsharp= (default)                                                                                        |
| -l              |                                                                                                                                             |
| --type=TYPE     | Acceptable values are =library= (default) or =exe=                                                                                          |
| -t              |                                                                                                                                             |

** TODO Adding source files/references/other files

#+begin_src
nproj add <...filenames> --project="."
#+end_src

|-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FILENAMES | One or more files to add to the project.                                         |
| --project | Directory of the project to add the files to. Defaults to the current directory. |
| -p        |                                                                                  |

Action depends on the file extension:
- *.cs or *.fs will be added as a compile include
- *.csproj or *.fsproj will be added as reference include
- *.dll will be added as a reference include
- anything else will be added as a data file

If it's a source file (*.fs, *.cs) and it doesn't exist, an empty file will be created.

For F# source file ordering matters, so will follow this rule:
- Program.fs to be the last item if present
- Successive items will be added to the end (but ahead of Program.fs)

In future it might be nice to parse =open= statements and =namespace=, =module= declarations to calculate the correct ordering.

** TODO Removing files

#+begin_src
nproj remove <..filenames> --project="."
nproj rm <..filenames> --project="."
#+end_src

** TODO Moving files

#+begin_src
nproj move <old_filename> <new_filename> --project="."
nproj mv <old_filename> <new_filename> --project="."
#+end_src

** TODO Converting to project.json

#+begin_src
nproj convert <project=".">
#+end_src

The fun part will be building the dependencies JSON, which can probably be achieved with Mono.Cecil.

** Issues/Todo list
*** Technical debt
**** DONE Throw away the prototype
CLOSED: [2015-07-18 Sat 05:57]
Done. Should probably tag last working prototype.
**** TODO Tests
xUnit 2.0 has errors with Mono 4.0.2, awaiting Mono 4.3
**** TODO Refactor with CQS project abstraction 
Microsoft.Build.Evaluation.Project's API is not very reasonable.
**** TODO Build process
At least need a makefile...
*** Third party
Issues with libraries, tooling, etc. Should raise bugs or make fix.
**** TODO The MSBuild library on NuGet does not work from fsx files, only compiled exes
The following code prints "30 items" when called from a compiled exe, but "0 items" when called from the fsx.
#+begin_src fsharp
#!/usr/bin/fsharpi --exec
#r "./Microsoft.Build.dll"
#r "./Microsoft.Build.Framework.dll"

open Microsoft.Build.Evaluation

let file = "/home/vagrant/Working/FSharp.ProjectTemplate.fsproj"
let proj = Project(file)
printfn "%A items" proj.Items.Count
#+end_src
**** TODO in Spacemacs 0.102.x on Ubuntu 14.04, I always get a segfault from the following sequence:
+ SPC f f (some file)
+ SPC w /
+ SPC f f (some other file)
Might not occur now emacs updated to 24.5?
